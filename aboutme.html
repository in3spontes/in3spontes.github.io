		About Me
	</h1>
	<p>
		I grew up in the suburbs of Lisbon, Portugal. As a child, I pursued a number of interests and activities, such as sports (swimming, karate, ballet, tennis), music (violin and orchestra) and other hobbies (reading, looking at the night sky, going to the beach, spending time with family and friends). I was the kid who liked and excelled on all subjects in elementary and middle school, and was therefore warned by my teachers that I might have a hard time choosing what I'd like to do later on, since my only weakness was my complete and utter lack of dexterity in gym class (I still loved it though). When I had to choose my area of interest at the end of the 9th grade, I was split between the Science and Technology area, the Humanities area and the Social and Economical Sciences area (the only other option was Arts, so I did have a hard time choosing). I ended up choosing Science and Technology in High School, therefore choosing STEM over the other academic disciplines.

		Halfway through High School, I discovered the incredible world of Astrophysics. I was instantly drawn to it, and began researching opportunities to study abroad in University (at the time, the educational offer in Portugal was very, very limited). I was admitted to a Fulbright program in 2016, designed to help students apply to US universities successfully, the Competitive College Club. There were fourteen students from the whole country participating in the first phase of the program that year. During the Summer of 2016, I was awarded one of five grants available through a partnership with the LAFD (Luso-American Foundation for Development), to help cover the testing and application fees.

		I was admitted to Hofstra University's Class of 2021, with a Presidential Scholarship, and I attended Hofstra for a year, during which I made it to the Dean's List on both semesters. Due to lack of additional funding and financial hardship (the wage gap between Portugal and the US is quite significant), I returned to Portugal, where I was able to enroll in the Engineering Physics program at Técnico Lisboa, one of the highest-rated programs in the entire country. I've been at Técnico ever since, exploring many subjects throughout my degree and finding out exactly what I am passionate about. You can find more information about my research interests and endeavours on the Research tab.
